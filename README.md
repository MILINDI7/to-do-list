# To-Do List Application

A simple and interactive To-Do List app built with React. This application allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. It demonstrates how to manage state and handle user inputs using React hooks like `useState`.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Remove tasks**: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
- **Mark tasks as complete**: Tasks can be marked as complete, with a visual change (e.g., strike-through text).
- **Persistent state**: The task list is saved in local storage so that the tasks persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Local Storage**: For saving tasks persistently.
